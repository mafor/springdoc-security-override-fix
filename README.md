# springdoc-security-override-fix

A workaround for a [springdoc-openapi](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi)'s bug, which does not allow to override global security settings for individual endpoints. 
See [springdoc-openapi/issues/259](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi/issues/259), [springdoc-openapi/issues/271](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi/issues/271) and [swagger-core/issues/2844](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/issues/2844)
